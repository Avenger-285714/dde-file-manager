Got a problem but don't know if it's related to Deepin File Manager? Then maybe you should report your issue to Deepin [Developer Center](https://github.com/linuxdeepin/developer-center/issues). We will help you find out which project your issue is related to.

If you just simply get a usage problem, you can ask in our [Deepin Offical BBS Forum](https://bbs.deepin.org/) and community peoples would like to help you out.

Both of these case you should consider post to these places instead of open a new issue, but feel free to open a issue if you got any other problem.
